To fix this, ensure all classes used with `@apply` are correctly defined in your Tailwind configuration.  Correct typos and add any missing classes. Here's the corrected HTML:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 bg-red-500">
</div>
```

Or, if you intend to use `@apply`, make sure `bg-red-500` is a valid Tailwind class. If not, define it in your `tailwind.config.js` file (or equivalent) under the `theme` object.

Alternatively, you can remove the `@apply` directive entirely and directly use the class names in the HTML: This is generally the preferred approach for better readability and maintainability.
